# Ahmad Harits Faza - Portofolio
# About
Hi, I'm Faza! I have an analytical background in Science Atmospheric and planetary and hold a Bachelor of Science degree. I recently completed a Data Scientist training program at Rakamin Academy, where I developed practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. With a strong foundation in the life sciences and a growing passion for uncovering insights through data, I’m excited to apply my technical and analytical skills in an entry-level data specialist role.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
